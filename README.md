<h2 align="center">Hey there! My name is Leon Rode ⌨️</h2>
<p align="center">
I'm a <strong>self-taught student developer </strong>from the US, learning all things computer science!
I've worked on the high level stuff, like websites and mobile apps, and I've dug into the nitty gritty C++ hardware and graphics work. I'm building a community on Instagram under the name of <strong><a href="https://instagram.com/solarcoder">SolarCoder</a> </strong>where I post Python tips and tricks. I'm currently freelancing on <strong><a href="https://www.fiverr.com/share/mDYyzz">Fiverr</a></strong>, too!
